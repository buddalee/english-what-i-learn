[如何停止討好別人？(How to Stop Being a People Pleaser)
](https://tw.voicetube.com/everyday/20190121)

[筆記]
*Before 30, I was a complete people pleaser. Getting 30, I still want to make people satisfied but also set out my principle of boundaries. ( it’s sensitive and needs nerves to talk about age...)

Here are seven questions to ask yourself to see you’re a people mountain pleaser:

1. Do you find yourself pretending you agree with everyone?

2. Do you often feel that you’re responsible for how others feel?

3. Do you apologize to others all the time?

4. Are you afraid of conflicts or of bothering other people?

5. You can’t say NO to others.

6. Do you feel uncomfortable when someone is mad at you?

7. Do you try to act like the people around you so you can fit it?

* To fit in: 合群，融入

Blunt: Being straight to the point.直白唐突的

It is a blunt fact that we humans are polluting our planet at an accelerating speed.

Blunt（鈍的） also refers to something is not sharp.

A blunt knife. A blunt pencil.

Putting it bluntly, I’m not buying it.直接了當的說了，我不買帳。

To put it bluntly, it is out of my price range.

The synonyms of brutal are harsh, cruel and heartless.

A brutal siteㄧ個殘忍的畫面
A brutal dictator ㄧ個殘暴的獨裁者
A brutal lessonㄧ個血淋淋的教訓

Brutal also can be saying what you think without trying to consider other’s feelings.

Brutal honesty(過度的直白）rarely works when it comes to communication.

To be brutally honest/frank, you look funny in that dress.

Poignant（辛酸苦楚的）, meaning a very sharp feeling of sadness or regret.

Music and old pictures have the power to evoke poignant memories（引起我們憂愁的回憶） making us sentimental for the time long gone（讓我們感傷已逝的時間）.

The defector(叛逃者）poignantly recalls （愁悵的想起）these days back in North Korea.

what a phony 很假仙
